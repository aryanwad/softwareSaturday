While this may not look like a big project, I used many different concepts, spreading out the content rather than stacking it

I took stuff I learnt from the first lecture such as:

breaks in HTML
paragraph tags in HTML
different header options in HTML
buttons in HTML
using ID in HTML

I also didn't include things such as divs which I learnt in the videos

I also used stuff such as:

color changing in CSS
using ID in CSS
using Classes to change CSS styles

Lastly, I used a ton of thing I learned in lecture 2 such as:

Functions in Javascript
how to use buttons to run functions in javascript
IF statements in Javascript
.getElementById
.getElementsByClass
console.log
and .innerHTML statements

All in all, the lectures were super helpful in getting me staretd with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I look forward to using these in React to create cleaner versions of the website I just made.
